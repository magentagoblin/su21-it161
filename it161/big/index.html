      <section class="accessibility"> <h1>Accessibility on the Web</h1>
      <p>To a person living with no disabilities, accessibility may not be very present in the world around them. However, to 25% of people in the U.S. alone (Why), accessible design is crucial, and a lack of it can be detrimental. Imagine walking to a building where you need to submit an important form, and for some reason, there are no stairs to get up to the front doors from the sidewalk. How could someone forget to build stairs for this important building? That situation seems ridiculous, but it's a very real scenario for many people with disabilities. The need for good accessible design is also present on the web.</p>
      <p>Often the most efficient methods of business are conducted via the web. Nowadays on the phone with most businesses (doctors, tech support, schools, the IRS, etc) there will be an automated message that directs you to try your issue on their website, as it could be resolved quicker online. With the amount of business that is done online, it's truly an equal rights issue to account for accessible design in web design. For this reason, the W3C has international web standards for website's accessibility. The standards account for disabilities including auditory, cognitive, visual, neurological, speech, and physical (Introduction) It's imperative that web designers thoroughly work on the accessibility of their sites in order to reach this large population of users, as well as remain consistent with other websites, and frankly, to avoid a lawsuit for not meeting accessibility standards. Financially as well, in the long run, time and money will have to be spent updating a website to be more consistent with accessibility standards-- especially if they're not taken into account from the get-go. AKEA is an organization that works with other organizations to test their websites and digital interfaces for specific accessibility standards, and help them make necessary updates (Why). </p>
      <p>In summation, accessibility is a key aspect of web design, and should always be implemented and tested for by web developers. It ensures that your content can be reached by all, on all different platforms, and gives users a consistent experience. Outside of the 61 million Americans with a disability, having good accessibility helps elderly users, mobile users, users who are less web savvy, users with temporary disabilities or environmental limitations, and the list can go on! (Introduction) Dismissing accessibility in the building of your web content is ultimately going to set you and your content behind.
